# SpellTomeRemoverNG

This patcher will remove spell tomes from the world, from containers, and from leveled lists.
This was made as an alternative to the SpellTomeYeeter, as it does not do containers.

## Settings
Currently, there are two settings, one for quiet run, and a plugin blacklist.

### Quiet Run
When checked, the patcher will not output any text.

### Plugin Blacklist
This setting will allow users to define a list of plugins where the patcher will skip removing spell tomes depending on what options are checked.

The options are as follows:
- Skip removing mod-added spell tomes
- Skip removing mod-added placed spell tomes
- Skip removing spell tomes from mod-added containers
- Skip removing spell tomes from mod-added leveled lists

#### Skip Mod-Added Spell Tomes
This option will allow the patcher to not remove any spell tomes added by the blacklisted plugin. This can be useful for mods without alternatives to obtain
said spells.

#### Skip Mod-Added Placed Spell Tomes
This option will allow the patcher to not remove any placed spell tomes added by the blacklisted plugin. This can be useful somtimes if a mod adds a puzzle hint using a spell tome.

#### Skip Spell Tomes From Mod-Added Containers
This option will allow the patcher to not remove spell tomes from any container added by the blacklisted plugin.

#### Skip Spell Tomes From Mod-Added Leveled Lists
This option will allow the patcher to not remove spell tomes from any leveled lists added by the blacklisted plugin.
